## Project Description

This is an real estate finding application where property owners can list their property for rent or for sale. Users can then search for properties in a dating-app style: only one property is shown at a time, and they can swipe left or right if they are interested in the property or not. If a buyer and seller match, they can message eachother to further negotiations about the property.

### Vision Statement

We want to make an app where buyers can view properties that they are interested in, sellers can list their property easily, and the two can communicate with eachother smoothly.

## History

Real estate websites right now are complex and present too many choices. When searching for an apartment or house, you frequently have to filter from hundreds of options, especially in a place like New York City. We believe that this app will assist with the real estate search process by only showing a user a single property at a time, in accordence with their preferences.
