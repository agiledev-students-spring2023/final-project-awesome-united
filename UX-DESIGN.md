[Account Creation frame](##account-creation).

## Footer
<br>

<br>

Present in every frame, except in the initial 'Account Creation' and 'New Account Selection' frames. The footer includes 3 clickable buttons, each when pressed will re-direct the end-user to a specific frame. 
- The 'Discover Screen' button redirects to [Discover frame](##discover)
- The 'Match List' button redirects to [View Individual Matches frame](##view-individual-matches)
- The 'Settings' button redirects to [Settings frame](##settings)

</br>


## Discover
<br>

<img src="ux-design/Discover.png" alt="Employee data" width="150" height="324" title="Discover Frame">

<br>

Frame from which a user can browse the properties listed. Clicking on either of the "yes" "maybe" or "no" buttons, will result in the user being shown a new property listing.

- The "yes" button saves the current property to the user's "yes" category. This category is for listings the user intends to pursue further.

- The "maybe" button saves the current property to the user's "maybe" category. This category is for listings the user is unsure of and needs more time to think on or inquire about.

- The "no" button saves the current property to a non-viewable "no" category.

In all these cases, properties that have previously been categorized into "yes", "maybe", or "no" will not be shown further to the user in the "Discover" frame

</br>

## View Individual Matches


<br>

<img src="ux-design/View-Individual-Matches.png" alt="Employee data" width="150" height="324" title="View Individual Matches Frame">

<br>

Shows all the "matches" a user has made. "matches" are any profiles with which a user has checked off as "yes" or "maybe". The user can switch between "yes" and "maybe" matches via the switch button on the upper right-hand corner. This switch really just filters the matches being shown within the frame.

A user's matches are listed vertically. If the user taps the profile picture of a match, it will take them to their match's profile. Additionally, if the user taps on the chat preview box or the name of their match, then the user will be re-directed to their chat session with the match.

</br>


## Profile View
<br>

Frame in which user can update their account info, update their preferences, filters, etc. "Change password" is clickable component that when clicked will take you to a seperate frame wherein a new password can be set.

"Account info" is another clickable component which when clicked will take the user to their <i>own</i> profile. Finally, "log off" is a clickable component which when pressed logs off the user and takes them to the initial page.
